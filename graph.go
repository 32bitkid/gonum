// A MutableGraph is a graph that can be changed in an arbitrary way. It is useful for several
// algorithms; for instance, Johnson's Algorithm requires adding a temporary node and changing
// edge weights. Another case where this is used is computing minimum spanning trees. Since trees
// are graphs, a minimum spanning tree can be created using this interface.
//
// Note that just because a graph does not implement MutableGraph does not mean that this package
// expects it to be invariant (though even a MutableGraph should be treated as invariant while an
// algorithm is operating on it), it simply means that without this interface this package can not
// properly handle the graph in order to, say, fill it with a minimum spanning tree.
//
// In functions that take a MutableGraph as an argument, it should not be the same as the Graph
// argument as concurrent modification will likely cause problems.
//
// MutableGraphs should always record the IDs as they are represented -- which means they are
// sparse by nature.

// MutableGraphs are required to keep the exact Nodes and Edges passed in, and return
// the originals when asked.
